Introduction</span></h1><p class="c3"><span>The Minnesota Historical Society maintains a large Microfilm collection. The Microfilm Database Application is a tool for accessing and maintaining this collection by Library staff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.efcxpic4qq62"></a><h1 class="c3"><a name="h.mhbxftgsyo6x"></a><span>II. For General Users</span></h1><p class="c3"><span>The microfilm management system is primarily available for staffing to keep track of its microfilm collection. &nbsp;Anyone can perform basic searches of the collection, however. &nbsp;To do so, you will need to create an account and navigate to the search pages.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.1nrhc33yw917"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.2yd85w359knk"></a><span>Creating and Updating an Account</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>In order to have any access to the records, you need to create an account. &nbsp;Creating a basic account is easy to do:</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Start on the home page. &nbsp;Open the drop-down menu at the button labeled </span><span class="c5">Users</span><span>. &nbsp;Select </span><span class="c5">New User</span><span>&nbsp;from the menu.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Next, in the Add User page, fill in all the fields and select </span><span class="c5">Submit</span><span>. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">Username</span><span>&nbsp;needs to be at least three characters long, and both the </span><span class="c5">Username</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">Password</span><span>&nbsp;need to be unique.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Finally, after submitting your new account, you are directed to a login page, where you can log in with your username and password. &nbsp;Logging in can also be done by following the </span><span class="c5">Login</span><span>&nbsp;link at the upper right of the page.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You can change details of your account - when logged in - by going to the </span><span class="c5">Users</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down menu and selecting </span><span class="c5">List Users</span><span>. &nbsp;On the Users page, you can click on some of your account attributes and edit them inline on the page. &nbsp;You can also choose the </span><span class="c5">View</span><span>&nbsp;link next to your account entry, and then in the User page choose the </span><span class="c5">Edit User</span><span>&nbsp;link to make changes.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.wru90rkalq85"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.e657ln4py96f"></a><span>Searching Records</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>When logged in, you have access to two types of microfilm records. &nbsp;These include newspaper and archive records. &nbsp;At the top of the page, two pull-down menus give you access to search either type of record.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Start by either </span><span class="c5">Standard Search</span><span>&nbsp;from either </span><span class="c5">Newspapers</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">Archives</span><span>. &nbsp;This will bring you to the </span><span class="c5">Records Search</span><span>&nbsp;page.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>At the top of the page is a form for searching records. &nbsp;Select </span><span class="c5">Search</span><span>&nbsp;to conduct a search. &nbsp;Below the search form are your search results. &nbsp;You can also select records from multiple searches using the checkboxes next to each record, then choose </span><span class="c5">Display Selected</span><span>&nbsp;to display all the selected records.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Double-clicking on any record will bring up a view showing the record in more detail.</span><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"></p><a href="#" name="id.vdkp24kcnv0c"></a><h1 class="c3"><a name="h.yr31n45k67z"></a><span>III. For Staffing</span></h1><p class="c3"><span>The microfilm management system helps you keep record of the microfilm collection. &nbsp;In addition to the basic functionality provided for basic users, you can search for records by their quality attributes, create new records, delete records, export a list of records to print labels, and switch to offline-mode to edit records without internet access.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.7334epn43lh4"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.7p8alzgh7e14"></a><span>Account Information</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>It is assumed that you already have an account and that your role in the account is set to either </span><span class="c6">staff</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c6">admin</span><span>. &nbsp;If not, you will need to create an account and contact the administrator to have your account role updated to staff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>As with basic user accounts, you can edit details of your own account.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Since you have a staff role, you are able to create other new accounts with a staff role.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.ynsquvnlgw8l"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.khtt02o1012q"></a><span>Searching Records</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>You have two collections that you can search - newspapers and archives. &nbsp;You also have two ways to search those records.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>At the top of the page are drop down menus labeled </span><span class="c5">Newspapers</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">Archives</span><span>. &nbsp;Selecting either will give you two search options - </span><span class="c5">Search Records</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">Quality Search</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Selecting </span><span class="c5">Search Records</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">Quality Search</span><span>&nbsp;will allow you to search the same records, although by different attributes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When in any of the search pages, double-clicking on a record gives you a detailed description of that record and a set of options for that record.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.c2jvdfk9y9ra"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.zd6u483k4u1"></a><span>Editing and Creating Records</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>You have multiple ways to edit a record, including inline editing of a record in your results view, editing a record in its own view, and editing records offline. &nbsp;The first two options are discussed here and the offline editing is discussed further below.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>When you choose </span><span class="c5">Search Records</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">Quality Search</span><span>, any records you search for can be edited inline. &nbsp;This means you can click on an attribute of a record and it will change to a form field or a date-picking calendar, allowing you to change that attribute.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>From either search page, if you double-click on a record, you will be directed to a page with a detailed description of that record. &nbsp;Selecting the </span><span class="c5">Edit Record</span><span>&nbsp;button will bring up a new view allowing you to change any attribute of that record. &nbsp;Selecting the </span><span class="c5">Delete Record</span><span>&nbsp;button will delete that record from the collection. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c5">Copy Record</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">New Content</span><span>&nbsp;buttons bring up views to create a new record that is a copy of the current record.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>With </span><span class="c5">Copy Record</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c5">New Content</span><span>&nbsp;buttons, you can create a new record using the existing values from another record. &nbsp;</span><span class="c5">New Content</span><span>&nbsp;keeps most of the values of the previous record, including publication or document information and image information. &nbsp;The </span><span class="c5">Copy Record</span><span>&nbsp;button keeps only the publication or document information.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>Creating an entire new record can be accomplished by going to the </span><span class="c5">Newspapers</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">Archives</span><span>&nbsp;drop-down menus and selecting </span><span class="c5">New Newspaper</span><span>&nbsp;or </span><span class="c5">New Archive</span><span>.</span></p><a href="#" name="id.yoaqvk7ymo1z"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.qf6nyd3ivzv5"></a><span>Editing Records Offline</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>Offline editing works by storing a set of record changes locally in your browser. &nbsp;This allows you to make changes in records even when you don&rsquo;t have a connection to the server. &nbsp;These changes become permanent when your server connection is restored and you submit your changes online.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>To edit records while offline, use the checkboxes to select any number of records. &nbsp;Using the action menu, navigate to a </span><span class="c5">Display all selected</span><span>&nbsp;page. &nbsp;There you will see a </span><span class="c5">Go offline</span><span>&nbsp;button. &nbsp;Clicking this takes your list of selected records to an offline page. &nbsp;Once here, you will no longer need a connection to the server. &nbsp;To edit a record simply double-click on it. &nbsp;The record will then open up in an editable form where you can modify the attributes of &nbsp;the record. &nbsp;Clicking </span><span class="c5">Save Record</span><span>&nbsp;on the form takes you back to the list of selected records. &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c3"><span>You will need a connection to the server to finally submit your offline changes. &nbsp;If you submit your changes without a server connection, a message will inform you that the submission failed. &nbsp;However, the changes will remain stored in your browser until the server connection is restored and your changes can be re-submitted.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.azu5rpu86kb3"></a><h2 class="c3"><a name="h.7kyb7wkbpz6s"></a><span>Exporting</span><span>&nbsp;Selected Records for Labels</span></h2><p class="c3"><span>To print labels, first use the search and selection checkboxes to indicate which records will require new labels. Once all records for labels have been selected, choose </span><span class="c5">Display Selected</span><span>&nbsp;from the buttons below the record search result list. Next choose the </span><span class="c5">Export Selected</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c5">for Labels </span><span>button and follow the prompts to save the Excel spreadsheet file. The spreadsheet includes the label fields required for continuing the existing process as documented in &lsquo;MHS Directions Label Merge.docx&rsquo;.</span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c0"><span></span></p><a href="#" name="id.yv5obfb4chjd"></a><h1 class="c3"><a name="h.41lmjz44lfzd"></a><span>IV.
