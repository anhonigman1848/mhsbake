You can change access to a behavior within a controller two
ways now:

1.  add it to the allow function call shown in beforeFilter
    as follows:
            -   $this->Auth->allow('NAME_OF_ACTION','display',
                'login','ANOTHER_ACTION');
            -   this gives everyone access to the action, even
                when not signed in.

2.  add it to the arrays shown in isAuthorized.  Two arrays
    exist.  One is for staff, and the other is for basic
    users.
