The "soft delete" action has been added to newspaperreelscontroller
and archivereelscontroller.  Now, the delete button as viewed from the
expanded views, will soft delete a record.  The admin has two additional
buttons, "Delete Permanently" and "Restore."  Actions for these buttons
has been added to the two controllers, also.

You will find that records that have been "soft" deleted will still be showing
up.  This is because we need to incorporate a condition (deleted=false) in the
search query.
